# About DrFrostHacks

Dr Cheat is a Chrome Extension that provides an answer to any questions on DrFrostMaths.com. Since it is not released on the official Chrome Extension website, you will have to download the code from here manually. This is a forked version of the Chrome Extension. I forked this and edited some code for my learning group.

## DrFrostHacks Setup/Installation
⚠️ NOTE THAT THIS HAS BEEN TESTED ON CHROME AND CHROMIUM, AND OPERA, FIREFOX, BRAVE AND MANY OTHER WEB BROWSERS MAY NOT SUPPORT THIS! EDGE MAY OR MAY NOT WORK AS IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED YET! ⚠️

1. Download the code from Github. On this page, click the green button with the text saying "code". A drop-down will appear and click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the contents into any folder, Download Folder is recommended but it won't affect anything!
3. Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder that you just extracted!
5. You are done! You can now use DrFrostHacks on any DrFrostMaths.com question.

Updates come now and again, and I won't support this app for that long!

*Okay* I know I say "APP" but it really is a Chrome Extension.

## Updates

Soon I will add DrFrostCoPilot!

What is DrFrostCoPilot?
Well it's ChatGPT just embeded into the extension. I will need to learn a bit of Javascript but It'll be worth it! :octocat:
